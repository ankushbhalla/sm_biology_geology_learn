Personal information you choose to disclose. You may, for example, provide us with your information when you post something on our Sites, when you register for any features on our Sites that require registration, when you contact us (online or offline) or when you order goods or services from us.         <\/p>       <\/li>       <li>         <p>           2. Website use information collected by us as you interact with our Sites.          <\/p>       <\/li>     <\/ol>     <p>       Our Cookies Policy     <\/p>     <p>       We use cookies (a small piece of computer code that we store for a period of time on your computer or mobile device) when you visit our Sites in order to make the Sites work better for you. The data we collect using cookies helps us understand our customers better so that we can provide a more focused user experience. Using the knowledge of your previous visits to our Sites, WSE can enhance subsequent visits by tailoring our content to match your requirements.     <\/p>     <p>       We use cookies principally because we want to make our Sites user-friendly, and we are interested in anonymous user behaviour. Generally our cookies don&apos;t store sensitive or personally identifiable information such as your name and address or credit card details. In the unlikely event that our Sites use cookies to store personal information about you, WSE encrypts the personal data to prevent unauthorised use by anyone else.     <\/p>     <p>       Here&apos;s a list of the main types of cookies we use, and what we use them for.     <\/p>     <ol>       <li>         <p>           1. <span class=\"underline\">Strictly Necessary Cookies<\/span>: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided. Because these cookies are strictly necessary we do not need to ask for your consent to use them.         <\/p>       <\/li>       <li>         <p>           2. <span class=\"underline\">Performance Cookies<\/span>: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. Some of these are analytics cookies, set using third party web analytics software, which allow us to understand more about how our website is used. For example, like many companies we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. These cookies don&apos;t collect information that identifies a visitor.  All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous and does not affect your privacy. It is only used to improve how a website works. We might also use these cookies to highlight WSE products or services which we think will be of interest to you based on your use of our Sites.         <\/p>         <p>           By using WSE&apos;s Sites you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.         <\/p>       <\/li>       <li>         <p>           3. <span class=\"underline\">Functionality Cookies<\/span>: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.         <\/p>         <p>           By using WSE&apos;s Sites you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.         <\/p>       <\/li>       <li>         <p>           4. <span class=\"underline\">Targeting or advertising cookies<\/span>: These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator&apos;s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.         <\/p>         <p>           Most of our Sites do not use targeting cookies.  We will ask for your consent before we use targeting cookies.         <\/p>         <p>           WSE&apos;s cookies typically contain:         <\/p>         <p>           WSE&apos;s cookies typically contain:         <\/p>         <ul>           <li>             <p>               A unique name set by the site that generated it             <\/p>           <\/li>           <li>             <p>               A value \u2013 the information within it that recalls your previous activities             <\/p>           <\/li>           <li>             <p>               An expiration date, which determines how long the cookie will remain active in your browser before being automatically deleted.             <\/p>           <\/li>         <\/ul>       <\/li>     <\/ol>     <p>       <span class=\"underline\">3rd Party Cookies and Social Networks<\/span>     <\/p>     <p>       If you click on a hyperlink from WSE&apos;s Sites to any third party websites (e.g. if you &apos;share&apos; content from WSE&apos;s Sites with friends or colleagues through social networks), you may be sent cookies from these third party websites.  Third party websites will have their own privacy and cookie policies which WSE cannot control. Please check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.     <\/p>     <p class=\"subtitle\">       IP address and browser     <\/p>     <p>       In a separate automatic operation the web server will collect your IP address and browser type and details of the website you came from before entering our Sites.
